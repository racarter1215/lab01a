# LAB01a

### Collaborated with Peyton Cysewski. All code comments are on the github code document

###### The purpose of this program is to allow a user to select a number, which then allows them to select more numbers based of the size of the first number selected. They are then able to manipulate these numbers by getting their sum, product, and quotient through subsequent methods.

###### One runs the program on the terminal (no front end required) off of Visual Studios. It runs by a Main method calling a StartSequence method. The main method also includes a "finally" to close the program after all methods are run. StartSequence then calls all subsequent methods as well as provide console.writeline's of additional information derived from the methods. Methods for creating the array length and content, as well as manipulation of said array data are then called by the other methods. All of this is displayed on the terminal for the user to see

###### THe user sees a terminal with preset questions for them to answer. Once they do, they see further questions, most with dynamically rendered information based off of previous information they gave.
